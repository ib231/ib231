<div class="paragraph">
<p>It all depends on your budget. The most expensive components will be your CPU and GPU, but before we get into pricing and what will suit you, as everyone will have different needs of their PC, lets look at each component and their function within a gaming PC.
As you do research on the web, please note that when deciding on hardware, focus your research on components that have been released in the last 3 years as hardware/peripherals are always improving and becoming more efficient.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the typical components needed when building a gaming PC:</p>

<h2>CPU/Processor</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>This is the brain of the your PC—it controls what and how fast tasks are completed. It is generally recommended to have at least 4 cores for gaming, while two cores is still acceptable, 4 cores will at least future proof for the immediate future.
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Motherboard</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>The motherboard can be compared to the nervous system of the human body. The CPU gives instructons but the motherboard is what communicates with all the other major components of the PC - GPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, and even wireless technologies - so that the CPU's instructions can be completed.
Please note that you should choose a processor and motherboard together as not all CPUs work with every motherboard and vice versa. This is because of compatibility requirments.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Graphics</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>There are two types of graphics—integrated and discrete (dedicated). Integrated graphics have gradually improved over time but for gaming performance we will be looking at discrete graphics cards such as Nvidia and AMD, who provide graphics cards for gamers who wish to play graphically demanding games. A graphics card converts video signals and performs complex calculations which transforms data into the rendered graphics in gaming. When looking at a GPU, a good measurement of performance is the frame rate. The frame rate tells us how fast an image is refreshed on the screen, as well as overall graphic quality. Frame rate is measured in frames per second (FPS). Typically, the minimum should be 60 fps.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Memory/RAM</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>Random Access Memory or RAM for short, will help a PC access files quickly and can run multiple operations at once without the PC suffering from slow downs. The general rule is the more RAM and faster the RAM, the better. While 8gb of RAM is seen as serviceable, 16gb is the sweetspot for gamers.</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Operating System</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>Operating Systems are used to support a computer's basic functions such as sechudling tasks, programs and applications. The most popular Operating systems are Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Storage - hard disk drive (HDD) &/or solid-state drive (SSD)</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>Most pc gamers believe that an SSD is a fundamental requirement in a PC build for its fast loading and quick booting times. But others prefer to maximise storage as SSDs are not cheap and are even more expensive depending on storage size required. The best advice is to compromise and get both. If you are on a budget, get a small SSD for booting and use your HDD for saving the larger files.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>A PSU converts the mains power to low voltage regulated power for the internal components of the PC. The quality of a PSU is important as a cheap PSU can fry your PC. It is recommended to use at least an 80+ Bronze PSU.
</p>
</div>
<div class="h2">
<h2>Cooling System</h2>
</div>
<div class="border">
<p>Gaming PCs will generate a lot of heat, especially when they are being pushed to their limits testing the maximum settings of a taxing game. GPUs and CPUs come with fans prebuilt into them to dissipate heat. PC cases either have fans built in or have room for new fans to be applied to help with extraction of heat. Heatsink also draw heat away from the components of a PC. For overclocking, a liquid cooling system would be recommended.
